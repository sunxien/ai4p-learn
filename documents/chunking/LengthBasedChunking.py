# Length-based
# The most intuitive strategy is to split documents based on their length.
# This simple yet effective approach ensures that each chunk doesn't exceed a specified size limit.
# Key benefits of length-based splitting:
#
# Straightforward implementation
# Consistent chunk sizes
# Easily adaptable to different model requirements
# Types of length-based splitting:
#
# Token-based: Splits text based on the number of tokens, which is useful when working with language models.
# Character-based: Splits text based on the number of characters, which can be more consistent across different types of text.
