# Unlike the previous methods, semantic-based splitting actually considers the content of the text.
# While other approaches use document or text structure as proxies for semantic meaning,
# this method directly analyzes the text's semantics.
# There are several ways to implement this, but conceptually the approach is split text when there are significant changes in text meaning.
# As an example, we can use a sliding window approach to generate embeddings, and compare the embeddings to find significant differences:
#
# Start with the first few sentences and generate an embedding.
# Move to the next group of sentences and generate another embedding (e.g., using a sliding window approach).
# Compare the embeddings to find significant differences, which indicate potential "break points" between semantic sections.
# This technique helps create chunks that are more semantically coherent, potentially improving the quality of downstream tasks like retrieval or summarization.
