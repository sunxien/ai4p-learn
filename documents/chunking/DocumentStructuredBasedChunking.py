# Document-structured based
# Some documents have an inherent structure, such as HTML, Markdown, or JSON files.
# In these cases, it's beneficial to split the document based on its structure,
# as it often naturally groups semantically related text. Key benefits of structure-based splitting:
#
# Preserves the logical organization of the document Maintains context within each chunk
# Can be more effective for downstream tasks like retrieval or summarization
# Examples of structure-based splitting:
#
# Markdown: Split based on headers (e.g., #, ##, ###)
# HTML: Split using tags
# JSON: Split by object or array elements
# Code: Split by functions, classes, or logical blocks
